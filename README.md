We opened tree tickets in total with the priority set to normal

At this level we loged in into osTicket as an help desk agent to work the tickets.

Prior to that we pretend to be a QR master and we go over the tickets to check if the priority and the severity are correct.
For this ticket we updated the priority level from normal to emergency because it is a bussiness impacting event.

For this ticket we updated the severity level to SEV-A. Because it is an bussiness impacting event.

On this picture we can notice that the ticket opened by Karen Karen saying that the entire mobile banking was dawn, the priority
has been updated from normal to emergency because it is an bussiness impacting event. And the ticket has been assigned to Jane Doe.

When Jane Doe received the ticket she sent a  note saying that she is collaborating with someone from the System administrator team
to solve the problem.
